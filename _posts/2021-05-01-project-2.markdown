description: If you seek for greater profit, you had to be willing to take greater risk! That's when the Negative Interest Rate comes to the picture.  <br><br>The concept of Negative Interest Rate was first introduced by a German theoritical economist Silvio Gesell. Although it is an unpopular theory, SmartLoan seeks to implement the concept on certain unfortunate cercumstance that happened to the borrower. In contrast to that, if the lender willing to take this risk, they will be awarded by high positive interest rates when the borrower experience good times.  Given an example, Alice borrowed $12k (24 months payment period, $500 monthly principal) for her study. After she graduate, she caught into an accident where she was permanently disabbled. In such circumstance, the Negative Interest Rate activated to cancel itself, forgiven her loan repayment every month.  <br><br>In another circumstance, after Alice graduated, she started a business and it became a huge success. She got extremely lucky and won a lottery. The high interest rate came into the system, in addition to that, the rate is calculated based on Alice's gross income. Where the success of her business and lottery winnings being part of the numbers. Therefore, the lenders successfully obtain a huge gain from the interest payment by Alice. This is a form of "Gratitude Economy", where Alice's payment of interest, is a form of action of gratitude towards those who supported her (the lenders) during her times of needs.
