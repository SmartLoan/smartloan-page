When Investor trasfered BUSD into the contract, same amount of SML token will be minted into his/her account. The BUSD in the contract account will work as the funding capital.

When the borrower pay the loan interest, the interest will be distributed to the SML token stake holders. When the borrower repay the principal, the floating SML token will be burnt. If the investor decided to keep the SML token, the funds will remain in the pool for other borrowers. The price of SML token is peg to BUSD, therefore, it is not a rocket to the Moon. It is simply a ship sailing on earth. <br><br>For details, do check out the github repository.
